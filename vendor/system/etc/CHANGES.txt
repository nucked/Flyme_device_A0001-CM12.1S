The baseline power is measured once and then used for each test to determine the delta current draw. - Removed waitForScreenOff() function - Added endTestsBecauseConnectionToDeviceLost() function - Added a flag "--max_baseline_amps" of type float to specify the max expected baseline amps for the device being tested - Tested this on Shamu and HH, and the power tests run until the end and PASS everything - several docstring comments added to functions, code cleanups, variable renaming for better description - Added a PowerTestException class Change-Id: I7190009882cc2d77d20138f10d4659ea1f39611d

11a02ed Support Motion JPEG This change uses the default Huffman tables when a JPEG image does not have DHT markers. When a Motion JPEG frame does not have DHT markers, it assumes a decoder uses the huffman tables suggested by the JPEG standard. Even though it is not compliant with the JPEG standard, it is useful to support such Motion JPEG because it is used by many webcams.
6eb4f20 Disable warnings in VS since they won't be fixed anytime soon.
313e025 Fix yasm warnings in libjpeg-turbo. This change fixes all yasm warnings in libjpeg-turbo (section redefinitions and unsupported declarations) so we can compile it without annoying warnings.
6640352 Support the 'use_system_yasm' variable (libjpeg_turbo). This change uses yasm installed to the system to build libjpeg_turbo if 'use_system_yasm' is 1 as requested by 'fta@ubuntu.com'.
7deb8d6 Formatting the readmes in deps to follow the proper format and making sure they contain Short Name and Version fields for version tracking.
321292e Fix invalid reads in libjpeg-turbo (libjpeg-turbo side) The maskmovdqu instruction seems to read data from memory before storing selected bytes and it causes InvalidRead errors when the output buffer does not have sufficient space for an XMM word. This change stores the output data without using maskmovdqu instruction when it does not have sufficient space. (The regression test for this issue is in another change because libjpeg-turbo is in a different repository from Chrome <http://codereview.chromium.org/6478021/>.)
6863548 Add PRIVATE flags to global symbols. This change adds the 'private_extern' flags (on Mac) or the 'hidden' flags (on Linux) to the all global symbols in libjpeg-turbo as suggested in <http://codereview.chromium.org/6332003/>.
51f9cb0 Cherry-pick a fix from r324 of the libjpeg-turbo stable branch that adds further protections against invalid Huffman codes.
f5b3dd3 Refactor the GYP file for libjpeg-turbo. This change cleans up the GYP file for libjpeg-turbo so we can directly build asm files in its 'libjpeg' target. (We can now do this because GYP Issue 102 is fixed.) Also, this change adds a 'RGBX_FILLER_OXFF' flag so libjpeg-turbo can produce the RGBA pixels compatible to Chrome/WebKit, i.e. we can remove the memory copy in gfx::JPEGCodec::Decode().
77347bb Remove workaround for gyp issue 102 and use libjpeg_turbo on Linux.
920a8a9 Add build files for libjpeg-turbo. This change adds a GYP file, header files, and a README file used for building libjpeg-turbo. (This GYP file builds libjpeg-turbo only on Windows and Mac since Linux uses the system libjpeg.)
f0c4f33 Adds libjpeg-turbo to our repository. This change lands the original libjpeg-turbo 1.0.1 (source files only) and NASM 2.09.2 (required for assembling .asm files on Windows) to "deps/third_party". I will send more changes to land its build files and patches to integrate it into Chrome.

Now it stops by returning a NULL frame. On Windows, it used to stop capturing when the window is minimized. Now fixed to match other platforms.

209791d Refactor in BitrateController module.  - Move condition of 0 bps as max meaning 1gbps from SendSideBandwidthEstimation to BitrateController.  - Remove condition on bitrate=0 meaning bandwidth estimation off as that could only happen when no observers existed    and in which case the estimation would be ignored.  - Add MaybeTriggerOnNetworkChanged which only runs rate allocation if any of the dependent variables has changed    thus allowing to remove many of the bool returns that try to indicate if the estimation has changed which would not    be aware if the observers have changed.  - SendSideBandwidthEstimation now has a UpdateBitrate and has clear code paths to which calls update bitrate.  - Changes in enforce_min_bitrate so the 10kbps min is set from the BitrateController and not from the outside this keep valid as observers are changed.

8eea45a Fixes: Resolves conflict that will happen when merging libjingle's and WebRTC's supplemental.gyp. By separating build_with_chromium and build_with_libjingle one can now just define build_with_libjingle in libjingle's supplemental.gyp. Once that is done it will be possible to merge the two supplemental.gyp-files. I.e. in WebRTC the supplemental.gyp would only set build_with_chromium to 0 since there is no longer any reason to disable logging and tests as they will be accessible in the same repository as libjingle.

10dff40 Use <(webrtc_root) to point to webrtc files in tools.gyp.
3f4b16d Delete {start,stop}CPULoad() since they're broken. - stopCPULoad is incorrect; since mIsBackgroudLoadRunning isn't declared   volatile, the empty while loop in the background thread isn't required to do a   memory read (as opposed to reading the value just once and caching it).  The   result is that stopCPULoad() may never return as the .join() waits forever. - startCPULoad isn't guaranteed to tax the CPU; the JVM is free to replace the   while loop in startCPULoad() with a thread pause since it can prove it'll   never exit the loop once entered (b/c of the previous item).
